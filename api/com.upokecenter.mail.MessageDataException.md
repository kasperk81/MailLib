# com.upokecenter.mail.MessageDataException

    public final class MessageDataException extends RuntimeException

<p>Exception thrown when a message has invalid syntax. </p> <p>This library
 may throw exceptions of this type in certain cases, notably when errors
 occur, and may supply messages to those exceptions (the message can be
 accessed through the <code>Message</code> property in.NET or the <code>
 getMessage()</code> method in Java). These messages are intended to be read by
 humans to help diagnose the error (or other cause of the exception); they
 are not intended to be parsed by computer programs, and the exact text of
 the messages may change at any time between versions of this library.</p>
