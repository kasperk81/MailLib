    <releaseNotes>
Version 0.9.2:
- Removed dependencies
Version 0.9.1:
- Removed a reference to OpenCover that was apparently left in version 0.9
Version 0.9:
- The C# version of the library now also targets "dotnet", which should make it compatible with platform .NET runtime
environments such as the upcoming cross-platform "coreclr" runtime.
- Bug fixes to ensure number-format independence in some cases
- ContentDisposition.MakeFilename implementation was improved
- Another overload for GetEncoding was added
- Additional fixes in character encodings
- Known issue: The library implements character encodings based on the Encoding Standard
candidate recommendation.  But several issues have emerged with that spec in the meantime.
For example, GB18030 currently uses a problematic range table, so that for certain code points designed
for that table, round-tripping is not possible.  As a result, tests on GB18030 are disabled
for now.
